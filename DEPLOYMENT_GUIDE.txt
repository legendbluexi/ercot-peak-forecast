1. In your new repository, click "Add file" → "Upload files"
2. Drag and drop BOTH files (app.py and requirements.txt) into the box
3. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

That's it — your code is now on GitHub.

STEP 4 — Create a free Streamlit account
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

2. Click "Sign up" and choose "Continue with GitHub"

2. Fill in the fields:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHAT THE APP DOES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

On load, the app automatically:
✓ Fetches 45 days of historical ERCOT North Hub DA and RT prices
  from ERCOT's free public API (no account needed)
✓ Fetches a 7-day hourly weather forecast for DFW from Open-Meteo
  (also free, no API key needed)
✓ Calculates projected on-peak (HE07–HE22) average DA and RT prices
  for each of the next 7 days
✓ Shows today's and tomorrow's headline prices vs 30-day historical avg
✓ Color-coded risk alerts (LOW / MED / HIGH)
✓ Weather icons and wind adjustments built in

Data refreshes every 30 minutes automatically.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
UPDATING THE APP IN THE FUTURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Any time you want to change something:
1. Edit the app.py file on GitHub (click the file → pencil icon)
2. Click "Commit changes"
3. Streamlit automatically redeploys within ~60 seconds

No need to touch anything else.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
IMPORTANT NOTES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

• Free Streamlit apps "sleep" after 7 days of no traffic.
  Just visit the URL and it wakes back up in ~30 seconds.
• ERCOT's public API occasionally changes endpoints.
  If prices show "—", it means the API call failed; the weather
  forecast will still work and model prices using default averages.
• This is a statistical model, not a market oracle. Treat forecasts
  as directional guidance, not trading signals.
